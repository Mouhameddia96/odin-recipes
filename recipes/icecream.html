        Vanilla ice cream is a classic dessert characterized by its creamy, smooth texture and sweet, aromatic vanilla flavor. It's typically made from a blend of milk, cream, sugar, and vanilla extract. After being churned and frozen, it has a firm yet soft consistency that's perfect for scooping. The light color and subtle flavor make it a versatile choice for pairing with a wide variety of other desserts or toppings.
